Hello, I am text on file 1.

Reflecting back on the show. It's hard to get over his character outside of the games. Middle age man living with/stealing from his elderly mother who can barley support herself, gambling the money away like a coward. Why does he have so many moral dilemas in the games? Also, through-out the show he's shown to be a liar.
